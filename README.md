Project 1:
  Automating the Layer 2 Cable Validation process.
    # layer_2_validation.py is my original work
    # app.py, index.html, results.html was GPT generated
    # tested on specific devices, but can be easily modified via layer_2_validation.py to accommodate other systems
  Requirements:
    - a Python venv with Paramiko and Flask insalled
  Description:
    > launching app.py launches index.html
    > input the device names belonging to a group of expected connected devices
    > input relevant SSH credentials
    > run the validation
    > observe the backend window if needed
    > compare results with expected results
